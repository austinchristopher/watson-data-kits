# Overview

The Travel Knowledge Kit service provides an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to leverage structured data on common travel attractions around the world to offer more meaningful choices in the context of an application. This API can be used foundationally, as the core of a new application, or to augment the offering of an existing application. 

The Travel Knowledge Kit service can also be used to support cognitive systems and train models to build more robust services and platforms.
